    <h1>Yep just say Hello!</h1>
    <p><b>TL;DR</b></p>
    <p>Modern chat communication should be done in a way that fosters a friendly environment and encourages personal interaction. Start with a “Hello” in chat. It’s a sign of respect and acknowledges the human on the other side.</p>
    <p><b>Chat Etiquette</b></p>
    <p> When you’re reaching out to someone in a chat, start with a greeting like “Hello”. It’s a small gesture, but it can set the tone for the entire conversation. It shows that you see the other person as a human being, not just a problem-solving machine.</p>
    <p>And HELLO back!</p>
